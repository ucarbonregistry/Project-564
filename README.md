The proposed project titled under UCR is “2.5 MW Bundled Small Scale Solar Power Project in
Arvalli, Gujarat.”, which is a grid connected solar power project located in the district Arvalli, in the
state of Gujarat, in India. The purpose of this power is for captive consumption. The promoter of the
project activity are ‘M/s. Shree Nandkishor Metals Pvt. Ltd., and M/s. Devkinandan Metals Pvt. Ltd.’
(herein after called as Project Proponent or PP). PP has the full ownership of the project activity. This
project is an operational activity with continuous reduction of GHG, currently being applied under
“Universal Carbon Registry” (UCR).

The purpose of the proposed project activity is to generate electricity using a clean and renewable source
of energy i.e., solar radiation. The proposed project activity of Solex with aggregated 2.5 MW (i.e.,
2500 kWp) is installation and operation of solar power plant at Village – Godha, Taluka – Meghraj, in
Arvalli district in the state of Gujarat are per details listed below:

As per the ex-ante estimate, this project will generate approximately 5,475 MWh of electricity per annum
considering an average PLF of 25%. The project activity uses Solex Monocrystalline Renewable solar
photovoltaic technology to generate clean energy. The generation of power from solar photovoltaic is a
clean technology as there is no fossil fuel fired or no GHG gases are emitted during the process.
Photovoltaic module consists of several photovoltaic cells connected by circuits and sealed in an
environmentally protective laminate, which forms the fundamental building blocks of the complete PV
generating unit. Several PV panels mounted on a frame are termed as PV Array. Thus, project activity
leads to reduce the GHG emissions as it displaces power from fossil fuel-based electricity generation in
the regional grid. 

Since the project activity generates electricity through solar energy, a clean renewable energy source it
will not cause any negative impact on the environment and thereby contributes to climate change
mitigation efforts.
